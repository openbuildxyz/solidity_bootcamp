- Introduction:
  
  - LotLoot is a social parking space battle game based on blockchain technology. Players can log in with their social accounts, own multiple cars and 5 parking spaces, and interact with other players to earn token rewards.

- Game Design:
  1. Network
     - [Scroll Sepolia Testnet](https://www.ankr.com/rpc/scroll/scroll_sepolia_testnet/)
     - [Mumbai](https://polygon-mumbai.blockpi.network/v1/rpc/public)
  2. Account Registration and Login:
     Users need to log in to the game with their social accounts like Facebook, Twitter, etc. New users will receive 3 randomly assigned initial cars and 5 parking spaces upon their first login.
  3. Parking Space and Car Rules:
     Each player has 5 parking spaces, with one parking space for their own use, and the remaining 4 parking spaces can be used by other players. When a car is parked in a space, it generates token income every second based on the car's quality. The income is capped at 24 hours, after which the car needs to be moved to collect the earnings. The car's quality and income rate can be upgraded by spending tokens.
  4. Social Interaction:
     Players can view their friends' parking spaces and decide whether to park their cars in their friends' spaces. Players can also invite friends to join the game through social features.
  5. Earnings and Penalty Mechanism:
     The owner of a parking space can issue penalties to cars parked in their space at any time, taking 90% of the current token income, while the remaining 10% goes to the car's owner. After issuing a penalty, the car is forcibly moved, and the parking space becomes available again.
  6. Upgrade Mechanism:
     Players can enhance the quality and base income rate of their cars by spending in-game tokens. Upgrading affects the token output rate of cars in parking spaces but does not affect the 24-hour income limit.
  7. Market and Trading:
     Players can buy, sell, or trade cars and parking spaces using tokens within the in-game marketplace. Market transactions are secured and transparent through blockchain technology.
  8. Leaderboards and Rewards:
     The game features daily, weekly, and monthly leaderboards based on total earnings, parking space utilization, and other metrics. Top-ranked players receive additional token rewards and exclusive in-game items.
  9. Future Expansions:
     The game will continuously introduce new cars, parking spaces, and social features to enrich the gaming experience and enhance player interaction. Through LotLoot, players can not only enjoy the fun of the game but also earn substantial token rewards through social interaction and strategic choices. Additionally, the application of blockchain technology provides a secure, fair, and transparent gaming environment for players.
